## Background
You are well on your way to becoming a programmer and Excel expert! In this homework assignment, you will use VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data.

## Before You Begin
  1. Create a new repository for this project called `VBA-challenge`.

  2. Inside the new repository that you just created, add any VBA files that you use for this assignment. These will be the main scripts to run for each analysis.

## Files
Download the following files to help you get started:

## Instructions
Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

  * The ticker symbol

  * Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock. The result should match the following image:

**Moderate solution**

  * Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". The solution should match the following image:

**Hard solution**

  * Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.

**NOTE**

Make sure to use conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

## Other Considerations
  * Use the sheet alphabetical_testing.xlsx while developing your code. This dataset is smaller and will allow you to test faster. Your code should run on this file in under 3 to 5 minutes.

  * Make sure that the script acts the same on every sheet. The joy of VBA is that it takes the tediousness out of repetitive tasks with the click of a button.

## Credits
In the creation of this code class notes were used as template
then office hours helped writing the code
then tutoring one on one
google and microsoft support
